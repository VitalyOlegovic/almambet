# Almambet - Email Reader

Email reader application built with Rust, featuring IMAP support, a web interface and a REST one.

## About the Name

The name "Almambet" is inspired by a significant character from the Kyrgyz epic poem "Manas". Almambet was a loyal friend and trusted advisor to Manas, the epic's protagonist. He was known for his wisdom, bravery, and unwavering loyalty. Like the character Almambet who served as a reliable messenger and advisor, this application serves as a trustworthy tool for managing and delivering your email communications.

## Configuration

The application will generate the following encrypted files and use them as a cache of your password:

- `.encrypted_password`: Encrypted email password
- `.encryption_key`: Encryption key for credentials

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/almambet.git
   cd almambet
   ```

2. Build the project:
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

3. Modify the configuration files inside the `resources` folder.

3. Run the program.

    * Run the spam filter once and exit:

      cargo run -- --once
      ```
